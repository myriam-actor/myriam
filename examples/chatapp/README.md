# chatapp

"small" example app demonstrating the use of local and remote actors.

## usage

set up a hidden service and then run with `cargo run -- <name> <port>` where `name` corresponds with the name of a Tor data directory inside `/tmp/chatapp` and `port` matches whatever port you set up your hidden service with.
